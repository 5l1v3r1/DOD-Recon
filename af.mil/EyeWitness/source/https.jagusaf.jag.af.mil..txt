		The Judge Advocate General's Corp selects a limited number of active duty officers each year to attend law school.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>FLEP</strong> -
            Active duty officers in the pay grade of captain or below with more than two years but less than six years of total active military service may apply to attend an ABA-accredited law school at Air Force expense.   Officers participating in this program receive their tuition, fees, and book allowance from the Air Force while continuing to serve on active duty, thus also receiving full pay, allowances, and other benefits while attending law school.  The FLEP tuition limits are set by the Air Force Institute of Technology on an annual basis and vary from year to year based on available funding.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>ELP</strong> - 
            Active duty officers in the pay grade of captain or below with more than two years but less than 10 years of total active military service may apply to attend an ABA-accredited law school.  Applicants must have less than three years in the grade of captain as of the first day of classes.  Officers in the ELP do not receive pay and allowances and must personally fund their law school education.  However, ELP participants continue to accrue time for promotion and retirement purposes and remain eligible for other active duty benefits such as Base Exchange, commissary, and medical services.
            </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
       The FLEP/ELP board is held annually in March.  For all our accession programs, applicants must schedule an appointment for a hiring interview with the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) at any active duty Air Force base. Applicants must schedule their interview appointment as early as possible, but before the 15th of the month prior to the month of the board that they wish to meet.

In addition to the full-time active duty positions described above, the Air
Force JAG Corps offers a part-time program for licensed attorneys, in the
Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard (over 900 ARC attorneys).  Together, these programs are
called the Air Reserve Component, or "ARC."  Licensed attorneys, even those
with no prior military experience, may apply for a judge advocate appointment in the ARC.  However, 
these judge advocate positions, however, are
intended for attorneys who have amassed significant practical experience as
licensed attorneys.  Applicants must be graduates of a law school accredited
by the American Bar Association and be active members of the bar of the
highest court of any state or territory of the United States, or the
District of Columbia.  United States citizenship is required.  Applicants
who have not previously served as commissioned officers must be commissioned
before their 35th birthday.  Selection for ARC judge advocate positions is
also conditioned on meeting medical and other qualification criteria for
appointment in the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard.
Applications for ARC judge advocate positions are accepted on a rolling
basis.  
<p>There are no application deadlines or selection boards.  Upon
receipt of an application, HQ USAF/JAR will contact the applicant to arrange for an interview with an active duty SJA.
