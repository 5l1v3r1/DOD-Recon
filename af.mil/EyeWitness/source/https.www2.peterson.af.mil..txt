                The Advanced Space Operations School evolved as a direct descendant of several world-class space training and education centers:<br>
				<br>
				The Space Tactics School (STS) which existed from 1994-1996 (and was later absorbed by the U.S. Air Force Weapons School in 1996), grew from lessons learned in Operation Desert Storm which found that campaign planning had not fully leveraged the nation's space capabilities. Initially the STS filled the void, but in 2002 the Space Operations School  (SOPSC)  was stood up to extended beyond the objectives of the STS and filled the breach by teaching broader space concepts and systems. The schools conducted a thorough examination of how to educationally prepare and train its warfighters, and instituted programs that addressed recognized shortfalls.<br>
				<br>
				The Space Commission Report of January 2001 amplified the need for more space education and training, noting the shortfall in growing space professionals at senior leadership echelons. The Commission's report served as a catalyst to help transform the SOPSC into the HQ NSSI, which officially activated in October of 2004.  The NSSI had two main schools, the Space Professional School, which was responsible for the Space Professional continuing education courses such as Space 200 and Space 300, and the Space Operations School, dedicated to teaching advanced space concepts, deployment training and instruction to non-space professionals.  In 2007, HQ AFSPC decided to reorganize the NSSI into two school; the Space Professional School would remain the NSSI and be relocated under Air University and the Space Operations School would be renamed the Advanced Space Operations School (ASOpS) and align under the Space Innovation and Development Center (SIDC).  On 1 April 2009 the ASOpS was activated taking the lineage of the 319 Space Training Squadron.  In April 2013, the Advanced Space Operations School was realigned under Headquarters Air Force Space Command's A3 Directorate.<br>
				<br>
 				Lineage: Designated as 3301 Space Training Squadron, and activated, on 1 Oct 1987. Redesignated as 319 Space Training Squadron on 4 Jan 1993. Inactivated on 1 Jul 1993. Redesignated as Advanced Space Operations School on 20 Mar 2009. Activated on 1 Apr 2009. Assignments: Lowry Technical Training (later, Lowry Training) Center, 1 Oct 1987-1 Jul 1993. Space Innovation and Development Center, 1 Apr 2009-. Stations: Lowry AFB, CO, 1 Oct 1987-1 Jul 1993. Colorado Springs, CO, 1 Apr 2009-. Service Streamers: None. Campaign Streamers: None. Armed Forces Expeditionary Streamers: None. Decorations: Air Force Organizational Excellence Award: 1 Oct 1988-30 Sep 1989. Lineage, Assignments, Stations, and Honors through 3 Apr 2009. Emblem: Approved on 30 Jul 1988.<br>
